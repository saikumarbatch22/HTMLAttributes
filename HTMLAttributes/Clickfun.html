    <!--Function
        Function is  a block of a code . 
        Functions are fundamental building blocks in all programming.
        Functions enable better code organization, modularity, and efficiency.
        Functions are reusable block of code designed to perform
        a particular task.
        Function execute when they are called or invoked.
        
        syntax: 
        function myfunction()
        {
        statements;
        }
        A function is defined with the keyword function followed by function name,with 
        parentheses() and then followed by brackets.
        Functions can reuse the code.
        We can write the code that can be used many times.
        we can use the same code with different arguments to get different results.
