    <!--JS Global Scope
        var is considered as a global scoper.
        variables declared with the var keyword can not have
        block scope/
       Variables declared with var inside a {} block can be accessed from 
        outside the block. where as varibales defiend with let cannot be redeclared.
        we cannot redeclare a varibale declared with let.
        ex::
        let a="rajesh";
        let a=10;
        so with var can be redeclared.
        var x="ABC";
        var a=20;
        
        SO we can say 
        let and const have block scope.
        let and const can not be redeclared.
        let and const must be declared before use.
        let and const does not bind to this.
        let and const are not hoisted.

        where as 
        var does not have to be declared.
        var  binds to this.
        var is hoisted.

        browser support let and const keywords.

        Not let us write all the data types using variables.
        --> 
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        const pi = 3.14;
        let person = "Ramu";
        let details = "Engineer";
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = pi + "<br>" + person + "<br>" + details;
    </script>
