        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
        document written in a markup language like HTML.
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
        including layout, colors, and fonts.
        CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
        CSS consists of selectors and declaration blocks.
        A selector is an HTML element that you want to style.
        CSS consits of a property and a value.
        syntax: selector {property: value;}
        Example: h1 {color: red;}
        CSS can be applied to HTML elements in three ways:
        Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
        Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
        External - by using an external CSS file
        Inline CSS:
        <h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
        Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
        The style attribute is used to specify the inline CSS.


        The <style> element is used to define style information (CSS) for a document.
        The <style> element is placed inside the <head> section.

        Internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
        Internal CSS is defined within a <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page.
        Internal CSS is useful when a single document has a unique style.
        Internal CSS is not recommended for large websites.
        Internal CSS is classifeid into three types:
        1. Element Selector:
        Element Selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
        Element Selector is used to apply a style to a specific HTML element.
        Element Selector is case-insensitive.
        syntax: selector {property: value;}
        Example: h1 {color: red;}


        2. Class Selector:
        Class Selector selects HTML elements based on the class attribute.
        Class Selector is used to apply a style to multiple HTML elements.
        Class Selector is case-sensitive.
        syntax: .class {property: value;}
        Example: .intro {color: green;}
        3. ID Selector:
        Id Selector selects a single HTML element based on the id attribute.
        Id Selector is used to apply a style to a single HTML element.
        Id Selector is case-sensitive.
        syntax: #id {property: value;}
        Example: #header {color: blue;}
