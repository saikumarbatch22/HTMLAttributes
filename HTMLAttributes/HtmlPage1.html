    <!--HTML ATTRIBUTES:
        ATTRIBUTES ARE ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART OF HTML MARKUP
        An Attribute is used to define the characteristics of an element and is
        placed inside the elemtns opening tag. All attributes are mode up of
        two parts a name and a value.

        Name: is the property we want to set. for ex
        the <font> element in the face is attribute with arital type face
        value here is airal.

        HTML tags have a unique set of their own attributes. Those will describe th page

        <marquee direction="right">

        Core Attributes:
        id
        title
        class
        style
        These 4 attributes can be used on the majority of HTML elements.

        ID attribute:
        The ID attribute can be used to uniquely identify  any element with in a page.
        There are two primary reasons that we might want to use an id
        attribute on an HTML element.

        if an elements carries an ID attribute as a  unique identifier it is possible to identify
        just that element and its content.

        if we have two elements with same name with in a web page(or stylesheet)
        we can use ID attribute to distinguish between elements that  have the
        same name.

        The Title attribute:The title attribute gives a suggested title for
        the element. They syntax for the title attribute is similar as
        explained for id attribute.

        The behaviour of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it
        often displayed as a tooltip while loading.

        class attribute:
        the class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and
        specifies the class of element.
        we learn more about classes under css part.

        style attribute:
        the style attribute allows to specify css rules with in the element.

        The dir attribute:
        it allos us to indicate to the browser the direction in which text should flow.
        The dir attribute take one of two values as we know/
        ltr:left to right(the default value)
        trl:right to left.

        Generic Attributes:
        Attribute               options:
        align                   right,left,center
        valign                  top,middle,botton
        bgcolor                 hexidecimal ,rgb values
        background              url
        id                      userdefiend
        class                   userdefined
        width                   numeric value
        <title>                 user defiend

        HTML comment tag.
        Comments are non executable statements.
        

        Presentation tags:
        if user want to read what we have written then struturing our text is more important.

        bold      <b>  </b>
        italic    <i>   </i>
                  <strong></strong>
                   <em></em>

        striking effect   <s></s>
        del           <del></del>
        underline     <u></u>
        subscript   <sub></sub>
        superscript  <sup></sup>

        Create Line Breaks:
        THe <br/> elements:
        if we use <br/> element anything following it starts on the next line.
        This tag is an example of an empty tag where we dont have attributes.


        The div and span elements: 
        The <div> and <span>elements allow us to group together 
        several elemtns to create sections or subsections of a page.

        For Ex:we can put all of the footnotes on apage with in <div> elements to
        indicate that all of the elements within that <div> elements relate to the footnotes.
        then we can attach some styles to the <div> elements so that 
        they appeat using special set of styles.   

        BlockLevel Elements:
        Block level elements appear on the screen as if they have a carriage return or line break
        before and after the,.
        for ex:
        <p>,<h1>,<h2>,<h3>,<ul>,<ol>,<dl>,<hr/>

        Inine Element:
        inline elements on the other hand can appear with in the sentences 
        and do not have to appear on a new line of their own.
        ex:<b>,<i>,<u>,<em>,<strong>,<sub>,<sup>,<li>,<del>.

        HTML images:
        Images are very important to a page 
        <img>
        Attriubute:
        src=where is the location of image.
        width:sets width of the image.
        heigth:height of the image.
        border:sets border around the image.
        alt:alternate text which will displayed if image is missing.
