    <!--Asynchronous Java Script
        Asunchornous Java Script allows code to run tasks in the background without
        blocking the main thread. This means app can stay responsive- handling user input,animations,
        or other taks -while waiting for things like API responses,timersm or file reads.
        
        Javascript is single threaded so without  async bbehaviour,long running tasks like
        fetching data would freeze the UI.
        Async code lets you schedule tasks,wait for events and respond to 
        user actions without delay.
        
        Technique                           Description
        Callbacks                           Functions passed as arguments to be executed after a task
                                            finishes.
        Promises                            Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of
                                            of an async task.
        async/await                         Syntactic sugar over promises for cleaner,readable async code.
        setTimeOut/setInterval              Schedule tasks after a delay or repeatedly.
        Fetch API                           Used to make network requestss asynchonously
        
        so we can say promise created: place the order.
        pending:
        fulfilled/
        rejected 
        why use of promises?
        avoids callbacks hell(nested callbacks)
        Makes aync code more readibale and maintainable.
        works seamlessly with async/await for modern syntax.
