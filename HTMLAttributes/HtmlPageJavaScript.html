    <!--Java Script:
        Java Script is a clinet side scripting language.
        It is used to make the web page more interactive and invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich,
        It is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
        It is designed for creating network-centric applications.
        It is complementary to and integrated.
        Java script programs are run by interpreter built into the users web browse(not on the server)
        Where does it fit in means clinet opens connection to server.
        Server end responds to the client.
        Client end uses HTML to structure the content.
        We can say Java Script is a dynamic computer programming language.
        It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pagesm whose
        implementation allows client-side script to interact with the user and make
        dynamic pages. 
         Java Script first known as Live script but Nesscape changed its name toJavaScript,
        Possibly because of the excitement being generated by java.
        Java script  made its first appearance in Metsacpe 2.0 in 1995 with th name
        LiveScript.
        The ECMA specification defined a standard version of the core javascript language.
        JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
        Designed or creating network-centric applications.
        Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
        Open and Cross-platform.

        Client-side JavaScript:
        Clinet-side  javascript is code that is executed by the client .
        Client-side  javascript is the most common form of the language.
        The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be
        interpreted by the browser.
        It means that a web page need not be a static HTML but can include programs that interact
        with the user,control the browser, and dynamically createe HTMl content.
        Advantages of Client-side JavaScript:
        1. Immediate feedback to the user.
        2. Less server Interaction.
        3. Increased interactivity.
        4.Richer interfaces.
        

        Lets write our first Javascripe code:
        Lets print Hello World on the web page.
        we can call function document.write() to write directly to the HTML output stream.
        The document.write() method writes a string of text to a document stream openend by
        document.open() method.
        The document.write() method is mostly used for testing.
        Lets see one exampe to print hello world on the web page  using java script.
        what ever we want to say need to write inside the java script tah followed 
        by script tag with document.write method.

        what can javascript do?
        1.JavaScript can dynamically modify HTML content.
        2.JavaScript can validate user input in forms.
        3.JavaScript can create interactive elements like image sliders and tabs.
        4.JavaScript can communicate with servers using AJAX.
        5.JavaScript can create cookies to store user preferences.
        6.JavaScript can create animations and visual effects.
        7.JavaScript can handle events like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.

        where to place the JavaScript code?
        1.In the head section of the HTML document.
        2.In the body section of the HTML document.
        3.In an external JavaScript file linked to the HTML document.

        Why we need to Use JavaSCript?
        HTML to define the content /structure of a web page.
        Css to specify the layout of web pages.
        Javascript is used to enhance the user experience on web pages by a variety of ways...
        JavaScript to program the behaviour of web pages.

        There are so many methods in java script.
        Some of the commonly used methods are:
        document.getElementById()- Selects an element by its ID.
        document.getElementsByClassName()-Selects elements by their class name.
        document.getElementsByTagName()-Selects elements by their tag name.
        document.querySelector()-Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
        alert()-Displays an alert box with a message.
        console.log()-Logs messages to the browser console.
        setTimeout()-Executes a function after a specified delay.
        setInterval()-Executes a function repeatedly at specified intervals.

        Events in Java Script:
        An event is an action that occurs in the system your are programming, which the system tells us about 
        so we can respond to it if we want.
        Example of events are:
        1.Mouse click: when the user clicks a mouse button.
        2.Page load
        3.Form submission

        6.Mouse out
        7.window resize.
        8.Input field focus.
        9.Input field blur.
        10.Scroll
        11.Context menu

        -->
    <script>
        document.write("Hello World");
    </script>
    <h1>Welcome to JavaScript</h1>
    <p id="demo">JAVA SCript by using HTML</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML='Hello JavaSCript'" >Change</button>
