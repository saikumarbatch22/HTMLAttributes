    <!--Array Object: AN Array is a collection of elements.
        Evenry element will be representing with one index value.
        first element will be represented with zero.
        2nd element represented with one and so on.
        in Java Script array  is a predefined object.
        
        creating user defiend array object:
        var courses=new array() here array is a predefiend object
   or   var courses=new array("dotnet","php","c++")
        
        Concat():
        It is a predefined method of array object,using this method we can
        concatinate one array into another array.
        Ex:var cousre1=new Array("dotnet","php","c++")
        var courses2=new Array("SAP","ABAP","FiCo")
        document.write(course1.concat(course2)+"")
        
        sort():
        using this method we can sort the elements of given array.
        var courses=new Array("dotnet","php","c++","asp")
        document.write(courses.sort())
        
        Date Object:
        It is one of the javascript predefiend object(Date())-
    By default date object will have the current date and time

        If we want to create a user defined date object
        var mydate=new Date()
        mydate is a user defiend date object where as
        Date() is a predefined object.
        -->
    <script>
        var mydate = new Date();
        document.write(mydate);
       // document.write(Date())
        var courses = new Array("DotNet", "PHP", "C++")
        
        for (var i = 0; i < courses.length; i++)
        {
            document.write(courses[i]+" ,");
        }
    </script>
