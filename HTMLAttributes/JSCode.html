    <!--JS Code blocks:
        Java script code can be placed in three different locations:
        1)Inside the head section
        2)Inside the body section
        3)In an External file which we will see later
        Here we will go with the body section.
        The <script> element is used to define a client-side script,such as Java script.
        The script element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an
        external script file through the src attribute.
        The script element is placed in the head or body section.
        Java script code is executed when the browser encounters it.
        Java script is case sensitive.
        Java script statements are separated by semicolons.
        Java script code is written inside the <script> element.
        The <script> element has two attributes:
        1)type :specifies the scripting langauge.
        2)src:spcifies the URL of an external script file.
        Java script files have a .js extension.
        Lets see an example:

        -->
   
    <h1>My First </h1>
    <p>This is my first web page using java script code.</p>
