       <!--Purpose of div tag in html form:
         The <div>
    tag is a block-level container used to group elements for styling or layout purposes.
           Div tags help organize the form into sections, making it easier to apply CSS styles and manage layout.
           Each div can contain a label and its corresponding input field, allowing for better control over spacing and alignment.
           Div tags also enhance the readability of the HTML code by clearly separating different parts of the form.
           Div tags can be styled individually or collectively using CSS, providing flexibility in design.
           Div tags do not inherently affect the functionality of the form but improve its structure and appearance.
           Div tags are semantically neutral, meaning they do not convey any specific meaning about the content they contain.

           Non Semantic elements like <div> are useful for layout and styling purposes.
           Div tags consits of opening and closing tags: <div> and </div>.
           under div tag we can use other html elements like label, input, textarea, select etc.
           sectioning of form using div tags is a good practice for better readability and maintainability of code.

           Form tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.
              The form element can contain various input elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons etc.
              The form element can also contain other HTML elements like div, span, p etc.
                The form element can be styled using CSS to improve its appearance.
                The form element can be used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing.

           Span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
              Span tags are often used to apply styles or classes to a specific portion of text within a larger block of text.
                Span tags do not inherently affect the layout or structure of the document, but they can be styled using CSS.
                Span tags are useful for applying styles to small sections of text without affecting the surrounding content.
                Span tags can be nested within other HTML elements, including div tags.
